# Raffle Codes Maker - Alpha
A Basic but useful Software to make Raffles, maintaining randomness and equity with all participants and preventing fraud, pairing every participant with an Id-card and a Unique Raffle Code, even if they take many Raffle Numbers, everyone of them has a Unique Raffle Code.

## How it works?
If you know a person plan to make a Raffle draw, or even you want to do it, this Software will help you do it.
Make the List of Raffle Numbers, start where you want and make the numbers quantity you want as well, the system will generate Raffle Unique Codes for every Raffle Number you have, also... if you export as Microsoft Excel, you can have the list of Raffle Numbers and the Unique Code that belongs to every one of them saved in a file, and you can print it if you want after that. This Raffle Number Unique Code must be printed on the Raffle Ticket you give to your participants. The idea is you register the Participant ID on the Excel file the app generates when you use the "Export as Excel" option, pair the ID with the Raffle number they choose, this way, the Unique Code printed on their ticket must match with the Excel Unique Code that belongs to that number on List. The draw day, the winner must comply with these characteristics:

#### 1. The codes matches between each other
#### 2. The Participant ID Number registered matches with the Participant ID Card Number that you have to request to the person on that time. 
#### 3. Their ID Card Picture matches with them in person.

If the winner meets all these requirements and everything is fine, it means that it is legal and the participant is accredited to receive the prize, but if at least one of them fails, the participant can not receive the prize until the requirement is met, but if it is impossible, you must repeat the draw to choose a new winner.

#### This system has been thought to prevent possible fraud coming from any participant.

After you export as Microsoft Excel, you can open the folder where you saved the file or open the file itself.
The idea with a future feature is that you are able to have settings where you can establish some details like the Raffle Name among others. Also on future features you're be able to save your raffles series in the application serverless-contained database, or in a MySQL Data Base Server.
